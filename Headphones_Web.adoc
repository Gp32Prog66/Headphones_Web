# Headphones Web

## What is the Headphones Web application all about?
The headphones web application is the User-Interface section of the Headphones project. Each headphone entry consists of an ID, brand name, model number, if it is wireless, and if it has
noise cancellation capability. 

## What is the FrontSide of the Website consist of?
The site consists of a home page that will allow you to view, add, and update specific different text fields of a headphone entry. There is also a section that containts earbuds with the same
column names in the same order, as well as viewing, adding and updating specific entries.

## What coding languages were using during the development of the Website? 
The site was developed using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. The library that was used is Grid.js for the grid like interface to retrieve data. Visual Studio was the IDE that was used to develop the project.

## User Interface Layout
When loading up the interface of the website, it will default to the headphones main page. To switch over to the earbuds main page, you click on the button to switch over on the headphones main page, and vice versa. You can access the add headphones, update headphones, and view headphones page from any section of the headphone side of the interface. The same concept is also applied to the earbuds section of the page. The add and update page will send in new information to the database. When viewing the information in the view page, a GET method will be used to retrieve the data for the user to view.

## GitHub Branch Layout
The Render server will retrieve all the necessary info to help display the site. Our local environment is connected to the GitHub repository and the developer will send information to the dev branch. Once you got everything ready, do a pull request. When the host reviews and approves the changes, everything will get pushed to the main branch.

## Server Flowchart
When the server is being implemented through Render, it grabs all the data from the PostgreSQL and Web Service environment. The render server will communicate with both Git Repositories for the Web and API section of the headphone project. The host site uses the main branch to deploy the web pages.
